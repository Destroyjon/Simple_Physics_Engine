# Simple_Physics_Engine
An ongoing process to make a physics engine using python.

I am using this goal as a way to learn python in and out. I am trying to only use pygame to render graphics, and the rest of the code will be what I have coded from the ground up. I have had the most trouble with getting collisions to look and feel realistic, I've gone through many iterations trying new things to make it look right. I am also struggling with performance, I could just blame python for being slow but I know my code and methods can be written more efficiently. So I am constantly rewritting a lot of code.
